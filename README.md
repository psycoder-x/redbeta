# Redbeta

Redbeta - is a library that simulates Minecraft redstone.

## What?

This library alows you to simulate a redstone circuit as a program.
The resulting program will represent a theoretically possible redstone circuit.
Theoretically - because the libray doesn't care about space managment,
and in reality the circuit may be impossible to build.

## Why?

I'm tired of space management when building a computer in Minecraft.
So I decided to simulate redstone for computations without spending time building.

## Goals

* Implement redstone components as functions
* Calculate a work time in game ticks
* Make examples
